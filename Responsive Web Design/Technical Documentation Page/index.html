                    Node.js is a very powerful JavaScript-based platform built on
                    Google Chrome's JavaScript V8 Engine. It is used to develop I/O
                    intensive web applications like video streaming sites, single-page
                    applications, and other web applications. Node.js is open source,
                    completely free, and used by thousands of developers around the
                    world.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This tutorial is designed for software programmers who want to learn
                    the basics of Node.js and its architectural concepts. This tutorial
                    will give you enough understanding on all the necessary components of
                    Node.js with suitable examples.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Before proceeding with this tutorial, you should have a basic
                    understanding of JavaScript. As we are going to develop web-based
                    applications using Node.js, it will be good if you have some
                    understanding of other web technologies such as HTML, CSS, AJAX, etc.

                    The definition of Node.js as supplied by its official documentation is as follows:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Node.js is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily
                        building fast and scalable network applications. Node.js uses an event-
                        driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient,
                        perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across
                        distributed devices.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Features of Node.js</h4>
                <p>Following are some of the important features that make Node.js the first
                    choice of software architects.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Asynchronous and Event Driven −</strong> All APIs of Node.js
                        library are asynchronous, that is, non-blocking. It essentially means a
                        Node.js based server never waits for an API to return data. The server
                        moves to the next API after calling it and a notification mechanism of
                        Events of Node.js helps the server to get a response from the previous
                        API call.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Very Fast −</strong> Being built on Google Chrome's V8
                        JavaScript Engine, Node.js library is very fast in code execution.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Single Threaded but Highly Scalable −</strong> Node.js uses a
                        single threaded model with event looping. Event mechanism helps the
                        server to respond in a non-blocking way and makes the server highly
                        scalable as opposed to traditional servers which create limited threads
                        to handle requests. Node.js uses a single threaded program and the same
                        program can provide service to a much larger number of requests than
                        traditional servers like Apache HTTP Server.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>No Buffering − </strong>Node.js applications never buffer any
                        data. These applications simply output the data in chunks.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>License − Node.js </strong> is released under the MIT license.
                    </li>

                <p>
                    Before creating an actual "Hello, World!" application using Node.js, let
                    us see the components of a Node.js application. A Node.js application
                    consists of the following three important components −
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Import required modules − </strong>We use the require directive
                        to load Node.js modules.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Create server − </strong>A server which will listen to client's
                        requests similar to Apache HTTP Server.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Read request and return response − </strong>The server created
                        in an earlier step will read the HTTP request made by the client which
                        can be a browser or a console and return the response.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Creating Node.js Application</h4>
                <p>
                    We use the require directive to load the http module and store the
                    returned HTTP instance into an http variable as follows:
                    <code>var http = require("http");</code></br> Step 2 - Create Server
                    </br></br> We use the created http instance and call http.createServer() method to
                    create a server instance and then we bind it at port 8081 using the listen
                    method associated with the server instance. Pass it a function with parameters
                    request and response. Write the sample implementation to always return "Hello
                    World".
                    <code>http.createServer(function (request, response) {
        // Send the HTTP header
        // HTTP Status: 200 : OK
        // Content Type: text/plain
        response.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});
        
        // Send the response body as "Hello World"
        response.end('Hello World\n');
        }).listen(8081);
        // Console will print the message
        console.log('Server running at http://127.0.0.1:8081/');</code>
                    The above code is enough to create an HTTP server which listens, i.e., waits for
                    a request over 8081 port on the local machine.<br></br>Step 3 - Testing Request &
                    Response</br></br>Let's put step 1 and 2 together in a file called main.js and
                    start our HTTP server as shown below:
                    <code>
  var http = require("http");

http.createServer(function (request, response) {
   // Send the HTTP header 
   // HTTP Status: 200 : OK
   // Content Type: text/plain
   response.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});
   
   // Send the response body as "Hello World"
   response.end('Hello World\n');
}).listen(8081);

// Console will print the message
console.log('Server running at http://127.0.0.1:8081/');
</code> Now execute the main.js to start the server as follows:
                    <code>$ node main.js</code>Verify the Output. Server has started.
                    <code>Server running at http://127.0.0.1:8081/</code>

        <section class="main-section" id="REPL_Terminal">
            <header>REPL Terminal</header>
            <article>
                <p>
                    REPL stands for Read Eval Print Loop and it represents a computer
                    environment like a Windows console or Unix/Linux shell where a command is
                    entered and the system responds with an output in an interactive mode.
                    Node.js or Node comes bundled with a REPL environment. It performs the
                    following tasks:

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Read −</strong> Reads user's input, parses the input into
                        JavaScript data-structure, and stores in memory.</li>
                    <li><strong>Eval −</strong> Takes and evaluates the data structure.</li>
                    <li><strong>Print −</strong> Prints the result.</li>
                    <li><strong>Loop −</strong> Loops the above command until the user
                        presses ctrl-c twice.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>The REPL feature of Node is very useful in experimenting with Node.js
                    codes and to debug JavaScript codes.</br></br>
                    REPL can be started by simply running node on shell/console without any
                    arguments as follows. <code>$ node</code> You will see the REPL Command
                    prompt > where you can type any Node.js command: <code>$ node
></code> Let's try a simple mathematics at the Node.js REPL command prompt:
                    <code>$ node
> 1 + 3
4
> 1 + ( 2 * 3 ) - 4
 3
></code>
                    You can make use variables to store values and print later like any
                    conventional script. If var keyword is not used, then the value is stored in
                    the variable and printed. Whereas if <strong>var</strong> keyword is used,
                    then the value is stored but not printed. You can print variables using
                    <strong>console.log()</strong>. <code>$ node
> x = 10
10
> var y = 10
undefined
> x + y
20
> console.log("Hello World")
Hello World
undefined</code>

            <article>
                <p>
                    Node Package Manager (NPM) provides two main functionalities
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Online repositories for node.js packages/modules which are searchable
                        on search.nodejs.org</li>
                    <li>Command line utility to install Node.js packages, do version
                        management and dependency management of Node.js packages.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    NPM comes bundled with Node.js installables after v0.6.3 version. To
                    verify the same, open console and type the following command and see the
                    result:
                    <code>$ npm --version
2.7.1</code>
                </p>

                <p>
                    If you are running an old version of NPM then it is quite easy to update
                    it to the latest version. Just use the following command from root:
                    <code>$ sudo npm install npm -g
/usr/bin/npm -> /usr/lib/node_modules/npm/bin/npm-cli.js
npm@2.7.1 /usr/lib/node_modules/npm</code>
                </p>

                <h4>Installing Modules using NPM</h4>
                <p>There is a simple syntax to install any Node.js module:
                    <code>$ npm install &ltModule Name> </code>
                </p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Callbacks_Concept">
            <header>Callbacks Concept</header>
            <article>
                <h4>What is Callback?</h4>

                <p>
                    Callback is an asynchronous equivalent for a function. A callback function
                    is called at the completion of a given task. Node makes heavy use of
                    callbacks. All the APIs of Node are written in such a way that they support
                    callbacks.
                    </br></br>
                    For example, a function to read a file may start reading file and return
                    the control to the execution environment immediately so that the next
                    instruction can be executed. Once file I/O is complete, it will call the
                    callback function while passing the callback function, the content of the
                    file as a parameter. So there is no blocking or wait for File I/O. This
                    makes Node.js highly scalable, as it can process a high number of requests
                    without waiting for any function to return results.
                </p>
            </article>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Event_Loop">
            <header>Event Loop</header>
            <article>
                <p>
                    Node.js is a single-threaded application, but it can support concurrency
                    via the concept of event and callbacks. Every API of Node.js is
                    asynchronous and being single-threaded, they use async function calls to
                    maintain concurrency. Node uses observer pattern. Node thread keeps an
                    event loop and whenever a task gets completed, it fires the corresponding
                    event which signals the event-listener function to execute.
                </p>

                <h4>Event-Driven Programming</h4>
                <p>
                    Node.js uses events heavily and it is also one of the reasons why Node.js
                    is pretty fast compared to other similar technologies. As soon as Node
                    starts its server, it simply initiates its variables, declares functions
                    and then simply waits for the event to occur.
                    </br></br> In an event-driven application, there is generally a main loop that listens for events,
                    and then triggers a callback function when one of
                    those events is detected.</br></br>Although events look quite similar to callbacks, the difference
                    lies in the fact that callback functions are called when an asynchronous function returns its
                    result, whereas event handling works on the observer pattern. The functions that listen to events
                    act as Observers. Whenever an event gets fired, its listener function starts executing. Node.js has
                    multiple in-built events available through events module and EventEmitter class which are used to
                    bind events and event-listeners as follows: <code>// Import events module
var events = require('events');

// Create an eventEmitter object
var eventEmitter = new events.EventEmitter();</code> Following is the syntax to bind an event handler with an event:
                    <code>// Bind event and event  handler as follows
eventEmitter.on('eventName', eventHandler);</code> We can fire an event programmatically as follows: <code>// Fire an event 
eventEmitter.emit('eventName');</code>

                    Many objects in a Node emit events, for example, a net.Server emits an
                    event each time a peer connects to it, an fs.readStream emits an event
                    when the file is opened. All objects which emit events are the instances
                    of events.EventEmitter.
                </p>

                <h4>EventEmitter Class</h4>

                <p>
                    As we have seen in the previous section, EventEmitter class lies in the
                    events module. It is accessible via the following code: <code>// Import events module
var events = require('events');

// Create an eventEmitter object
var eventEmitter = new events.EventEmitter();</code> When an EventEmitter instance faces any error, it emits an 'error'
                    event. When a new listener is added, 'newListener' event is fired and when a listener is removed,
                    'removeListener' event is fired. </br></br> EventEmitter provides multiple properties like on and
                    emit. on property is used to bind a function with the event and emit is used to fire an event.

                    Pure JavaScript is Unicode friendly, but it is not so for binary data.
                    While dealing with TCP streams or the file system, it's necessary to
                    handle octet streams. Node provides Buffer class which provides instances
                    to store raw data similar to an array of integers but corresponds to a
                    raw memory allocation outside the V8 heap.
                    Buffer class is a global class that can be accessed in an application
                    without importing the buffer module.
                </p>

                <h4>Creating Buffers</h4>

                <p>
                    Node Buffer can be constructed in a variety of ways.
                </p>

                <h5>Method 1</h5>
                <p>
                    Following is the syntax to create an uninitiated Buffer of 10 octets:
                    <code>var buf = new Buffer(10);</code>
                </p>

                <h5>Method 2</h5>
                <p>
                    Following is the syntax to create a Buffer from a given array:
                    <code>var buf = new Buffer([10, 20, 30, 40, 50]);</code>
                </p>

                <h5>Method 3</h5>
                <p>
                    Following is the syntax to create a Buffer from a given string and
                    optionally encoding type: <code>var buf = new Buffer("Simply Easy Learning", "utf-8");</code> Though
                    "utf8" is the default encoding, you can use any of the following encodings "ascii", "utf8",
                    "utf16le", "ucs2", "base64" or "hex".

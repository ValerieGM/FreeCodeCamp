                Samuel Langhorne Clemens (November 30, 1835 â€“ April 21, 1910), known by his pen name Mark Twain, was an
                American writer, humorist, entrepreneur, publisher, and lecturer. He was lauded as the "greatest
                humorist [the United States] has produced", and William Faulkner called him "the father of American
                literature".His novels include The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1876) and its sequel, the Adventures of
                Huckleberry Finn (1884), the latter often called "The Great American Novel".

                Twain was raised in Hannibal, Missouri, which later provided the setting for Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry
                Finn. He served an apprenticeship with a printer and then worked as a typesetter, contributing articles
                to the newspaper of his older brother Orion Clemens. He later became a riverboat pilot on the
                Mississippi River before heading west to join Orion in Nevada. He referred humorously to his lack of
                success at mining, turning to journalism for the Virginia City Territorial Enterprise. His humorous
                story, "The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County", was published in 1865, based on a story that
                he heard at Angels Hotel in Angels Camp, California, where he had spent some time as a miner. The short
                story brought international attention and was even translated into French. His wit and satire, in prose
                and in speech, earned praise from critics and peers, and he was a friend to presidents, artists,
                industrialists, and European royalty.
